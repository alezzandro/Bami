This is just a proof-of-concept. Dont expect it to be a solution for anything, but it
may be useful for certain things. It can login to an ami server and listen for events.

Configure
---------
Edit bami.sh and setup log path, and AMI username and password.

Running
-------
You will need something like netcat. Example:

nc 127.0.0.1 5038 -e ./bami.sh
